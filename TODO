= TODO
===================================

* Job System (probably need custom synchronization primitives to go with it)
* Map out rendering architecure more completely
* Consider gpu memory allocation strategy, likely need to allocate larger buffers and use offsets to allocate within
* Signed Distance Fields
* Consider entity system architecture
* Polar Coordinates
* SSE support
* Projection Matrix: add w normalization for depth buffer precision
* Add FOV calculation for X/Y
* Cleanup CMake behavior with dlls
* Pak filesystem for file I/O
